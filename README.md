# SnakeByYasteelGungas

I was inspired by watching dave shiffman of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) to create a retro snake game in the browser using plain vanilla javascript at the time.

## GAME RULES

- The snake will be able to grow as it eats Food
- The snake can eat itself and grow shorter
- The snake will die if it hits any boundaries (i.e the walls)
- For 2 Player, snakes will be able to eat any food, however, eating opponent's food will shorten your snake. The game will end when both snakes die

### Controls for Single Player:

### Controls for 2 Player:

Player 1:
